###Prisma schema

The Prisma schema file (short: schema file, Prisma schema or schema) is the main configuration file for your Prisma setup. It is typically called schema.prisma and consists of the following parts:

    Data sources: Specify the details of the data sources Prisma should connect to (e.g. a PostgreSQL database)
    Generators: Specifies what clients should be generated based on the data model (e.g. Prisma Client)
    Data model definition: Specifies your application models (the shape of the data per data source) and their relations

See the Prisma schema API reference for detailed information about each section of the schema.

###Prisma Client

Prisma Client is an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's tailored to your data. The easiest way to get started with Prisma Client is by following the Quickstart.

https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client

npm install prisma --save-dev

npx prisma init --datasource-provider postgresql

npx prisma migrate dev --name init

npm i --save-dev prisma@latest                       â”‚
npm i @prisma/client@latest
